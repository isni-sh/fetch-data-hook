## Intro

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to develop dynamic web applications using Next.js and leverage the power of Tailwind CSS for efficient styling. We'll integrate a fake API to fetch data and demonstrate how to implement a search bar functionality for filtering and displaying specific data based on user input. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to combine Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and fake API integration to create a seamless user experience with dynamic URL routing and filtered data retrieval.
